<h1><b>NISSAN SILVIA S15</b></h1>
<p>And Silvia S15 is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive (RWD), sports car that </p>
<p>was manufactured and marketed by Nissan from 1999 to 2002. Its wheelbase </p>
<p>looks like the perfect one for drift, short enough to allow easy direction </p>
<p>change and long enough to keep the vehicle stable while drifting.</p>
