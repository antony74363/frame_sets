<p>Mazda made their RX7 FD model very easy to modify, thanks to the fairly </p>
<p>simple bodywork of their engine. This also made it one of the most popular </p>
<p>cars in the tuning world. Modifiers have a lot of room to play around with, </p>
<p>and some even took the engine to new heights by making it churn out </p>
<p>a ridiculous 1000 horsepower.</p>
