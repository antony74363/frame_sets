<b><p>The Supra turbo engine is seriously overbuilt. Bone stock it made 320 HP</p> 
<p>but that was just a good starting point. The engine itself could handle enough </p>
<p>airflow with the right turbo and fuel system to make 500hp on stock internals.
<p> Upgrading rods and pistons would push that to 800+.</p>

<p>The inline 6 engine was super smooth, sounds wicked, and combine that with RWD</p> 
<p>and a suspension that could be made to handle very well, the car is simply fantastic</p> 
<p>as it is or even more awesome when modified. Oh, and it’s very easy to work on and </p>
<p>very reliable as well, even when modified. It’s a perfect car for someone who likes</p> <p>to play with cars.</p></b>
